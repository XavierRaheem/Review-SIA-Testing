My mom got her windows done over a month ago and when they put in the window they said theyd replace the window they broke. We've had our windows for over a month now and they still haven't replaced it. My mom had them come and personally check it out and they said they'd put the referral in to get the new window as if they didn't when they put the windows in and broke it. She now got off the phone with them and they still haven't put a referral in for the window. They also said they'd fix our patio door that they messed up. Pretty unprofessional and they seem to not have good communication between the workers there. The customer service is horrible. They really only care about getting your money and then doing the bare minimum when doing the windows. They've definitely ripped my mother off and every other window company we've talked to since this happened said that this is the worst job they've seen. Would not recommend what so ever to anyone.
