They initially promised effective communication, but I encountered some challenges during the project. I could only effectively communicate with one staff member, and she was accommodating in following up with me. However, she never did on the day she was supposed to communicate with me, and I couldn't get ahold of her when I called. Another staff member made an appointment to speak to me but never showed up. Finally, when we met, I was told another staff member agreed to come instead and then forgot about my appointment. It was just such a horrible experience for me. On a positive note, the installers did an excellent job with the roof installation, and they are the primary reason for my three-star rating (my roof looks fantastic). Although I regret the experience with the company, I understand that I couldn't stop the process once my old roof was removed. The other staff members could provide a better customer experience with some improvements in their communication skills. However, based on my experience, I will explore other businesses for future home improvement projects.
