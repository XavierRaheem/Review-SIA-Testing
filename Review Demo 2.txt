Super unimpressed after having Preston come out a roof replacement. Preston was fantastic - friendly, informative, and diligent. But their sales process sucks. It’s entirely designed to set up a high-pressure close in the moment and not allow you to get any other quotes. I already had one quote in hand, and the DaBella’s quote came in around $8000 to $10,000 more.
Meanwhile, they’re giving you a whole song and dance about how “we want customers for life”. Forcing customers into signing a contract on the spot is very much at odds with that. Overhearing the phone call between Preston and his sales manager (J? G?) was horrifying - the manager said word for word, “get a signature now or never talk to him again”. I don’t make $15,000-30,000 buying decisions without getting competing quotes and having time to discuss them, nor should anyone.
This isn’t the type of company that I want to do business with.
Edit in response to the reply from the business: Their entire sales process is designed to put you in a high pressure sales situation. From asking you to have all decision makers present at the time they come to give a quote, to saying they have no way to sign contracts or receive payment electronically (and that their sales person wouldn't make any money if he had to come out twice), to offering discounts that are only good if you sign right away, the entire thing is designed to pressure you into signing without considering other quotes. And no, I'm not going to call and speak to "customer support" so they can continue to pressure me into a sale. If they wanted to "review and improve their approach", they already have sufficient info to do that. This is an intentional choice.
